* Overview

This project investigates food insecurity patterns across the United States using the USDA Food Access Research Atlas dataset (2015). The analysis combines Python (for data cleaning and EDA) and Tableau Public (for interactive visualization) to reveal trends in food accessibility, socio-economic disparities, and geographic distribution of vulnerable communities.

 * Dataset Source

Name: Food Access Research Atlas, Source: USDA ERS

Year Represented: Primarily 2015 (with population base from 2010 Census & 2010‚Äì2014 ACS)

Rows: 72,531 census tracts

Columns: 147 fields (demographic, geographic, income, and food access indicators)

* Tools & Technologies Used

Python (Jupyter Notebook)

pandas, matplotlib, seaborn for data wrangling and EDA

Tableau Public

Visual storytelling through bar charts, maps, pie charts

Git/GitHub for version control and portfolio presentation

* Key KPIs Explored

Low-income population distribution

Urban vs Rural food insecurity ratio

Geographic clustering of low-access census tracts

Top states with the highest number of food-insecure regions

üîç Exploratory Data Analysis Highlights (Python)

Identified the top 10 states with the most low-income + low-access tracts

Performed Urban vs Rural segmentation

Filtered clean data and exported as CSV for Tableau use
